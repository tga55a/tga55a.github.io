            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a programmer with experience in game development on Roblox.</p>
            <p>I primarily work on back-end systems. Though occasionally, I  ocassionally work on the frontend, where I mainly employ math skills to design visually appealing mechanisms.</p>
            <p>I have always been fascinated by the world of programming and game development has intrigued me since I was young, and I enjoy the intellectual challenges that it presents.</p>
            <p>I hope to gain exposure to more professional roles and build more experience in this field.</p>
