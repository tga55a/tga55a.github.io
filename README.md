### Favorite Links
[Roblox](www.roblox.com)
- This platform is very cool because there are a ton of games you can play. There are also more serious roleplay groups on the platform.
  
[Discord](www.discord.com)
- This platform is cool because this is where roblox roleplay groups communicate. There are also tons of other non-roblox related communities you can join.
  
[Udemy](www.udemy.com)
- This platform is cool because this is where you can learn new skills. *Sometimes* the courses get incredibly cheap, usually around $9.00+
