                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a programmer with experience in game development on Roblox.</p>
                <p>I primarily work on back-end systems. Though occasionally, I  ocassionally work on the frontend, where I mainly employ math skills to design visually appealing mechanisms.</p>
                <p>I have always been fascinated by the world of programming and game development has intrigued me since I was young, and I enjoy the intellectual challenges that it presents.</p>
                <p>I hope to gain exposure to more professional roles and build more experience in this field.</p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p><strong>Naruto Rougelike Closed-Community Game:</strong> This was an open-world rougelike game on Roblox that I helped maintain from late 2021 to mid-2022. The project gained significant popularity and was the most well-known Naruto rougelike on the platform at the time. Working on this game allowed me to gain valuable experience in game development and community management within a closed-community setting.</p>
                <p><strong>Roblox United Kingdom:</strong> In 2021, I joined the development team of Roblox United Kingdom, a roleplay group, as an Interim/Junior Developer. Since then, I have remained an active member of the team, contributing to ongoing projects and updates that enhance the gameplay and engagement within the group.</p>
                <p><strong>Roblox Netherlands:</strong> I am currently assisting a roleplay group based in the Netherlands by helping to rebuild their codebase. This project involves updating and optimizing existing systems, as well as integrating new features to improve the groupâ€™s roleplaying experience.</p>
